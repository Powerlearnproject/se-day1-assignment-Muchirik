    as expected.
5.  **Deployment**: The software system is deployed to the production environment.
6.  **Maintenance**: Providign ongoing support, updates and enhancement to deelopment software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer:
Waterfall:

- **Predictive**: Waterfall is a predictive methodology, meaning that the entire project is planned out in advance, and changes are difficult to make once the project is underway.
- **Linear**: Waterfall follows a linear approach, where each phase is completed before moving on to the next one.
- **Sequential**: Waterfall is a sequential methodology, meaning that each phase is completed before moving on to the next one.

Agile:

- **Iterative**: Agile is an iterative methodology, meaning that the project is broken down into smaller chunks, and each chunk is developed and delivered in a series of iterations.
- **Flexible**: Agile is a flexible methodology, meaning that changes can be made easily and quickly
- **Collaborative**: Agile is a collaborative methodology, meaning that the development team works closely with stakeholders to ensure that the project meets their needs. Scenarios where Waterfall would be appropriate:
- **Small projects**: Waterfall is suitable for small projects with well-defined requirements and a fixed scope.
- **Projects with a fixed budget**: Waterfall is suitable for projects with a fixed budget,
  where changes are difficult to make once the project is underway.
  Scenarios where Agile would be appropriate:
- **Large projects**: Agile is suitable for large projects with complex requirements and a
  high degree of uncertainty.
- **Projects with changing requirements**: Agile is suitable for projects with changing requirements, where flexibility and adaptability are essential.
